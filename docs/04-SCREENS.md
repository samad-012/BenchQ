# 04 — Screens

**Project:** BenchQ · frontend only
**Version:** 1.0 · September 2026

Every route, its layout, its states, its permissions and its keyboard map. If a screen isn't in
here, it doesn't get built — propose it first.

---

## 0. Rules that apply to every screen

**Three states, always.** Skeleton while loading, empty when there's nothing, error when the
adapter throws. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_ERROR_RATE=0.1` and walk the app — every error state you hit
must already exist.

**Light first.** Light is the default render; dark is a preference the user opts into. Both are
first-class and both ship complete — but design and review in light, and treat dark as the theme
that must also be correct, not the one that leads. Given the 6:30 PM – 12:30 AM IST shift, expect
dark to get heavy real-world use, so it never becomes an afterthought.

**Density.** This is a production console, not a marketing site. Per design.md v3, default row height
is 36px, compact 32px, comfortable 44px. The setting persists per user in `localStorage`.

**Timezones.** Any timestamp that matters to a US-facing action renders as a `DualTimestamp` —
client-local time primary, IST secondary. Never show a bare UTC string.

**Permission rendering.** A control the current role cannot use is **not rendered at all**. Do not
render a disabled button as a hint that a feature exists. The one exception is the export gate,
where the disabled state *is* the message.

**Counts are derived.** Every number on every screen comes from `src/lib/derive/`. A fixture never
supplies a count.

Sidebar: 208px expanded, 60px collapsed, 48px mobile icon rail, state in `localStorage`. Items carry live badge counts
(follow-ups due today, unreviewed unverified claims). Badges are derived, and a badge of zero is
hidden, not rendered as "0".

**Shift clock** in the topbar is not decoration. It shows current US Eastern time alongside IST and
how much of the 6:30 PM – 12:30 AM IST window remains. At 11:45 PM IST it turns amber. The BDE is
working against a clock; the product should acknowledge it.

### 1.2 Command palette (`⌘K` / `Ctrl+K`)

One input, grouped results, arrow keys to move, `Enter` to run, `Esc` to close. Groups in order:

1. **Actions** — New candidate, Capture job, New application, Start outreach
2. **Candidates** — fuzzy over name, title, skills
3. **Jobs** — fuzzy over title, company
4. **Navigation** — every route

Recent items show when the input is empty. The palette is the fastest path to everything and it
gets built in Phase 1, not as a nice-to-have at the end.

### 1.3 Global keyboard map

| Key | Action | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `⌘K` | Command palette | Global |
| `g` then `d` | Go to dashboard | Global |
| `g` then `c` | Go to candidates | Global |
| `g` then `j` | Go to jobs | Global |
| `g` then `a` | Go to applications | Global |
| `g` then `f` | Go to follow-ups | Global |
| `J` / `↓` | Next row | Any list |
| `K` / `↑` | Previous row | Any list |
| `Enter` | Open focused row | Any list |
| `Space` | Toggle row selection | Any list |
| `x` | Select / deselect row | Any list |
| `/` | Focus the list's filter input | Any list |
| `T` | Tailor resume for focused job | Job feed, job detail |
| `A` | Mark applied | Job detail, application detail |
| `O` | Open outreach composer | Job detail, application detail |
| `N` | New (context-dependent) | Any list |
| `Esc` | Close panel / clear selection / go back | Global |
| `?` | Keyboard shortcut sheet | Global |

`?` opens a modal listing every shortcut available in the current context. Build it in Phase 1 and
keep it accurate — it's the cheapest documentation in the product.

## 2. Auth and onboarding

### 2.1 `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`, `/invite/[token]`

`AuthShell`: centred card, product mark, no sidebar. There is no real auth in this repo — the form
validates with Zod, shows the error state on a deliberately wrong password (`wrong@benchq.io`), and
on success writes a session into the Zustand store and routes to `/dashboard`.

Build the states properly anyway: field-level validation, a submit-pending state, a form-level
error banner, and a "check your email" confirmation on sign-up. These are cheap now and expensive
to retrofit.

`/invite/[token]` shows the inviting firm's name and the role being offered before the accept
button. An expired token renders its own state with a "request a new invite" action.

### 2.2 `/welcome` — onboarding wizard

Four steps, progress rail on the left, back/next, resumable (step index in `localStorage`).

1. **Firm** — name, timezone, shift window (defaults to 18:30–00:30 IST)
2. **Invite team** — email rows with role selects; skippable
3. **First candidate** — name, title, work authorisation, resume upload (drop zone simulates a
   parse with a 3s progress state, then shows extracted fields as `UNVERIFIED` claims for review)
4. **Done** — three suggested next actions, routes to dashboard

The resume-parse simulation in step 3 is the first time the user meets the unverified/verified model. Make
it legible: the extracted fields arrive visibly drafted, and confirming one flips it to verified with
the transition described in `design.md`.

---

## 3. `/dashboard`

Role-dependent. Same route, three compositions.

### 3.1 BDE view — "tonight"

The BDE's dashboard answers one question: *what do I do next?*

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tonight · 4h 12m left in shift          [Start a run ▸]     │
├──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┬────────────────┤
│ Applications │ Follow-ups   │ Responses    │ Unverified claims  │
│ 23 / 40      │ 7 due        │ 3 new        │ 5 to review    │
│ ████████░░   │              │              │                │
├──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┴────────────────┤
│ My candidates (6)                                            │
│ ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ Adnan Khan · Sr. Java Dev · H1B   12 apps  2 int  ●●●○○  │ │
│ │ Priya Raman · Data Eng · GC        8 apps  1 int  ●●○○○  │ │
│ └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Queue — highest-match jobs not yet applied                   │
│ [job row]  [match 87]  [T tailor] [A applied] [O outreach]   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The **queue** is the centre of gravity. It's a keyboard-driven list: `J`/`K` to move, `T` to
tailor, `A` to mark applied, `O` to open outreach, `Enter` for detail. A BDE should be able to work
twenty jobs without touching the mouse. Time the interaction yourself — if it takes more than two
keystrokes per job to progress, the design is wrong.

"Start a run" opens focus mode (§9).

**Empty:** no candidates assigned → a single card pointing at the manager. No jobs in queue → an
illustration and a "capture jobs" action.

### 3.2 MANAGER view — "the floor"

Same shell, different content. Team throughput today versus the trailing seven-day average, a
per-BDE strip (applications, responses, interviews, follow-ups overdue), candidates with no
applications in 48 hours flagged in amber, and the pipeline funnel. Every per-BDE row clicks
through to that BDE's filtered application tracker.

This is the transparency feature made concrete. The manager should be able to answer "who is
behind, and on which candidate" in under five seconds of looking at this screen.

### 3.3 OWNER view — "the business"

Manager content plus placements this quarter, time-to-placement trend, cost per placement, and
seat / usage against plan. Read-only rollups; the owner drills into the manager views for detail.

### 3.4 VIEWER view

Manager view with every action stripped. No buttons in the DOM, not disabled buttons.

---

## 4. Candidates

### 4.1 `/candidates` — list

Toolbar: search, filters (status, work auth, employment type, assigned BDE, skills), density
toggle, view toggle (table / cards), `New candidate`.

Table columns: name + avatar, title, work auth chip, status, assigned BDE, applications (30d),
active applications, interviews, last activity, match-ready resume count. Sortable, multi-select
with a bulk bar (reassign, change status, export CSV).

A BDE sees only assigned candidates and the assigned-BDE filter is hidden for them — there's
nothing to filter by.

**Empty:** first-run illustration + `Add your first candidate`. Filtered-to-nothing is a *different*
empty state with a `Clear filters` action — don't reuse the first-run one.

### 4.2 `/candidates/new`

Single-column form, three sections: identity (name, email, phone, location, timezone), professional
(title, years, work auth, employment type, rate expectation, availability), and sourcing (resume
upload, LinkedIn URL, assigned BDE).

The resume drop zone simulates a parse. Extracted fields land as `UNVERIFIED` and the form shows a
review strip: *"14 fields drafted from the resume — review before saving."* Fields the user types
by hand are `VERIFIED` immediately, because the user is the evidence.

### 4.3 `/candidates/[id]` — detail

The page a BDE lives in for one candidate. It answers, in order: *what needs me now*, *where does
every submission stand*, *what did recruiters say*, *where do I submit next*.

**Header.** Initials avatar, name, work-auth chip, candidate status, role · location · years ·
target rate, availability and relocation. The owning BDE shows to managers and owners only — a BDE
looking at their own candidate doesn't need it. Actions: `Find jobs` (runs the matching
sequence inside the Jobs tab — never navigates away) and `Build resume`. Below it, the derived
stat strip (applications, active, interviews, offers, response rate, days on bench); **every stat
is a button** that opens the tab behind it.

**Tabs** — sticky under the top bar, selection slides between tabs, the active tab is kept in the
URL (`?tab=inbox`) so back/forward and shared links work. Arrow keys move between tabs. Counts
show on Applications and Resumes; a dot marks Overview and Inbox when something is new.

| # | Tab | Why it sits here |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Overview** | What needs the BDE tonight, then the pipeline and the facts he quotes on calls |
| 2 | **Applications** | Where every submission stands — the working board |
| 3 | **Inbox** | What recruiters said, matched to applications, with suggested status updates |
| 4 | **Jobs** | Where to submit next, ranked for this profile |
| 5 | **Resumes** | What to submit — the master resume is the verified source |
| 6 | **Documents** | What vendors ask for: visa papers, ID, certificates, screening answers |
| 7 | **Activity** | The audit trail a manager opens |

There is no separate Profile/Record tab: it duplicated the master resume and left the BDE unsure
where to fix a claim. The Record stays as the data model behind the master resume.

#### Overview
Left: **Needs your attention** — upcoming recruiter calls and interviews, recruiter emails whose
stage the pipeline hasn't caught up with (one-click *Move to …*), follow-ups due within a day,
"connect the inbox" when it isn't, visa / ID / certificate files expiring within 60 days, and
unverified claims in the master resume (*Review* opens the builder on the first one). Five show, the rest behind
*Show more*; resolving one animates it out. Then **Pipeline** (current count per stage, animated
bars, each row opens the board) and **Latest from recruiters** (four newest emails, or the connect
prompt). Right: **Submission facts** (work authorization + validity, rate and floor, availability
and notice, employment types, relocation, target roles — editable in place, the rate floor can't
exceed the target), **Resume readiness** (verified share of the master resume's claims, with *Review
unverified claims* → `/resumes/[id]?review=1`), **Best new matches**.

#### Applications
Toolbar: *Active / All* and *Board / List*, plus a one-line summary. When emails suggest updates, a
violet strip lists them as one-click chips. **Board** — the shared `ApplicationBoard`: one column
per stage, drag one stage forward (anything else snaps back with the reason), a read-only *Closed*
column under *All*. Cards show role, company, the latest recruiter email as a chip, days in stage
(amber at 3, red at 7) and the next follow-up. **List** — role, company, status, six-dot stage
progress, latest email, applied date. Enter or click opens the **application drawer**: stage
progress with dates, the suggested update, *Move to next stage* / *Mark not selected*, the
**resume sent** (the exact version the client received — master or tailored, template, ATS, with a
warning when the resume has been edited since), every matched email, and a link to
`/applications/[id]`.

#### Inbox
The candidate's Google account, connected by the BDE (candidates apply from their own address).
Not connected → a connect card: what it does, a read-only consent step, then a staged first sync
("Connecting → Reading → Matching to N applications → Found N updates"). Connected → address, last
sync, *Sync now*, *Disconnect*; filter chips with counts (All, Needs update, Interviews,
Shortlisted, Calls, Offers, Not selected); list + reader. The reader shows the proposed call or
interview time (IST, relative), the matched application with its progress, and either *Move to …*
or "pipeline is up to date". Nothing changes on its own — every update is confirmed.

Signals detected per email: `SHORTLISTED`, `CALL_REQUEST`, `INTERVIEW_SCHEDULED`, `ASSESSMENT`,
`OFFER`, `REJECTED`, `CONFIRMATION`. A suggestion is **derived**: it exists only while the
application's stage is behind the stage the email implies.

#### Jobs
The profile-locked job explorer. `Find jobs` plays the matching sequence (read profile → filter by
work authorization → score → rank) with real counts, then the ranked list staggers in.

#### Resumes
The same cards as the Resume Builder library, master first, plus a *New resume* tile. A note explains
that the master resume is the verified source every tailored copy reuses. The export lock shows on
the card itself. Claims are verified in the builder (*Verify with evidence*); a claim cannot be
verified without an attached evidence id.

#### Documents
Left: an upload area (drop or browse; the type is detected from the file name and can be changed;
expiry is asked for visa, ID and certificates), then files grouped by type — work authorization,
identity, resumes, certifications, education, employment letters. Each row: title, file, size,
added, an expiry badge (expired / expires in N days / valid to), "Evidence for N claims" when the
file backs verified claims, *Copy link*, and remove with an inline confirm. An amber banner lists
anything expired or expiring within 60 days. Right (sticky): **Screening answers** — the
candidate's saved answers to standard vendor questions, each with *Copy*, plus *Copy all*.

#### Activity
Status changes and recruiter emails, newest first, grouped by day under sticky day headers, with
actor ("Adnan Khan" / "Automated"). Filter: Everything / Status changes / Emails. Any row opens its
application.

---

## 5. Jobs

### 5.1 `/jobs` — feed

Two panes: filter rail (240px) + virtualised list. Filters: candidate context, match score range,
work-auth fit, client type, remote mode, rate, posted within, source type, hide already-applied.

**Candidate context is the important control.** Selecting a candidate at the top of the rail
re-scores the whole feed against that candidate and enables `T` / `A` / `O` on every row. Without a
candidate selected, the feed is just a list; with one, it's a work queue.

Row: title, company + verification badge, location + remote mode, rate, posted age, source chip,
`MatchScoreBar`, and inline actions. Selecting a row opens a peek panel on the right without
leaving the list — the BDE evaluates most jobs without ever navigating.

Virtualise past 100 rows. 500 rows must scroll at 60fps.

**Empty:** no jobs captured → a card explaining the two capture paths with a link to `/jobs/capture`.
Filtered to nothing → clear-filters state.

### 5.2 `/jobs/capture`

Three tabs.

**Paste** — a textarea that accepts a URL or a raw job description. On submit, a 2–4s parse
simulation, then a review form with every extracted field as `UNVERIFIED`, side by side with the
source text so the BDE can check the parse. Confirm to save.

**Bulk paste** — multiple URLs, one per line. A progress list with per-row status (queued →
parsing → parsed → duplicate → failed). Duplicates surface the existing job with a "view" link
rather than silently dropping.

**Extension** — an install/status panel. Not connected to anything in this repo; renders the
"not installed" and "connected" states from a store flag.

Dedup runs on capture. A duplicate shows a comparison card: what you pasted, what already exists,
and a choice of merge or keep separate.

### 5.3 `/jobs/[id]`

Header: title, company, verification badge, source chip with legal basis, posted and captured
timestamps. Two columns: description with matched requirements highlighted, and a right rail with
the match panel (`ScoringRecord` — requirement-by-requirement HAVE / MISSING / ADJACENT), company
card (H-1B / LCA data, client type, prior applications from this firm), and the action stack
(`Tailor resume`, `Mark applied`, `Start outreach`, `Save`, `Dismiss`).

If the match is `LIGHT` depth, the panel shows a `Run full analysis` action that upgrades it —
matching the JobNavigator cost-control split. The upgrade is an AI simulation per
`03-MOCK-DATA.md §5`: staged progress, 2–5s, output arrives `UNVERIFIED`.

---

## 6. Resume builder — `/resumes` and `/resumes/[id]`

**Library — `/resumes`.** Every resume as a card: file icon (master vs tailored), resume name,
candidate, role, and monospace tags for type, version, ATS score and template. The footer shows
"Ready to export" or the unverified-claim count. Search, a type filter and a candidate filter sit
above the grid. **New resume** and **Upload resume** are the page actions. Clicking a card opens it in
Builder mode; the card's **View** button opens it in Viewer mode.

**The studio — `/resumes/[id]`.** Opens full screen, outside the app shell: no sidebar, no top nav.
A close button (and `Esc`) returns to wherever it was opened from. `?mode=view` opens in Viewer mode;
`/resumes/new` starts a new resume from a candidate's record or blank, and
`/resumes/new?upload=<file>` opens a parsed upload in which every line starts unverified.

```

```

- **Builder mode** — collapsible section forms on the left (Header, Summary, Experience, Skills,
  Education, Certifications, Projects), live page on the right. Rows reorder and remove in place.
  Every claim shows its state chip and a **Verify with evidence** action. Enter in a bullet starts
  the next one.
- **Viewer mode** — the page itself, centered, with a slim outline rail. Click any text to edit it
  where it sits. Selecting text in a claim raises a floating toolbar: bold, italic, underline and
  **Ask AI** (improve wording, make concise, add measurable impact, fix grammar; `⌘J` opens it).
- **Templates** — six styles (Classic Serif, Modern, Minimal, Executive, Compact, Two Column). The
  ‹ › arrows (or `[` `]`) step through them; the name opens a strip of live thumbnails rendered from
  this resume's own content. The page is always white in both themes — it is the printed document.
- **AI output always lands unverified** — a rewrite from the selection toolbar or a **Tailor with
  AI** run marks the affected claims unverified and flashes them.
- **Export PDF** prints a clean copy of the page through the browser's print dialog.

**The export gate.** The export button is disabled whenever any claim in the resume is `UNVERIFIED`.
The disabled state carries the reason: *"3 claims need review before export"* with a link that
focuses the first one. This is the one place a disabled control is correct — the block is the
product's point, and hiding it would teach the wrong model.

`CONTRADICTED` claims are excluded from the page and the export entirely, and shown in Builder mode
with a line-through.

---

## 7. Applications — `/applications`

Three views over one dataset, toggled in the toolbar, selection preserved across the switch.

### 7.1 Kanban
Columns per `ApplicationStatus`. Cards: candidate, job, company, days in stage, next follow-up,
owning BDE. Drag between columns transitions status optimistically and writes a ledger event; an
invalid transition snaps back with a toast naming why. Column headers carry derived counts and
column WIP is visible at a glance.

### 7.2 Table
TanStack Table, virtualised, grouping by candidate / BDE / company / status, column visibility and
order persisted, CSV export of the current view. This is the manager's view.

### 7.3 Calendar
Month and week. Applications on their submitted date, interviews on their scheduled date,
follow-ups on their due date. Click any item for the peek panel. Useful for spotting the days
nobody worked.

### 7.4 `/applications/[id]`
Header with candidate → job → company and the current status. Body: the status timeline with dual
timestamps and actor, the resume version used (with a link to the exact version, not the latest),
the outreach thread, follow-ups, screening answers pulled from the Q&A bank, and notes.

Status changes happen here or on the kanban; both write the same ledger event.

---

## 8. Outreach, follow-ups, analytics, ledger

### 8.1 `/outreach`
Left: contact list per application, with verification state. Right: composer with template
selection, merge-field preview, and a claim check that refuses to send if the message body contains
a unverified claim pulled from the record. Sent items show channel, timestamp, and result.

There is no sending in this repo. "Send" logs the outreach locally and advances the mock thread.

### 8.2 `/followups`
Grouped: overdue (red), today, this week, later. Row: candidate, job, kind, due, owner. Actions:
done, snooze (1d / 3d / 1w / custom), cancel, open application. Bulk complete from the selection
bar. Overdue count feeds the sidebar badge.

The default rhythm is day-3 LinkedIn, day-7 email — generated when an application moves to
`APPLIED` and visible here immediately.

### 8.3 `/analytics` — MANAGER+
Date range and comparison period across the top. Sections: funnel (applied → response → screening →
interview → offer → placed, with conversion between each), throughput over time by BDE, per-BDE
table with submissions / response rate / interviews / placements, per-candidate performance,
company response rates, and source effectiveness.

Every chart is Recharts, every chart has a table equivalent behind a toggle, and every chart has an
empty state for ranges with no data. Charts must be readable in both themes — check the axis and
grid colours, not just the series.

### 8.4 `/ledger`
Append-only, immutable, virtualised. Filters: actor, entity type, action, date range. Row: dual
timestamp, actor, action, entity, and a diff expander showing before and after. No edit, no delete,
no exceptions — the ledger is the thing the manager trusts.

```

Single keystroke per decision, auto-advance, progress across the top. `Esc` exits and returns to
the dashboard with a session summary: jobs reviewed, applications logged, time spent.

This screen is the time-compression feature in its purest form. If it works, the product works.
Build it in Phase 5, after the pieces it composes are solid — but design everything before it with
the knowledge that it exists.

## 10. Settings

| Route | Role | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `/settings` | OWNER | Firm name, logo, timezone, shift window, default follow-up cadence |
| `/settings/team` | OWNER, MANAGER | Member table, invite flow, role changes, candidate assignment matrix |
| `/settings/templates` | OWNER, MANAGER | Resume templates and outreach templates, with preview and merge-field reference |
| `/settings/preferences` | all | Theme, density, keyboard shortcut sheet, notification preferences, timezone display |

`/admin` is `PLATFORM_ADMIN` only: firm list, seat usage, feature flags. Mock data only, and it
never appears in the sidebar for any other role.

## 11. Responsive

| Width | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| ≥ 1440px | Full layout, all panes, peek panels |
| 1024–1439px | Sidebar auto-collapses, three-pane becomes two with a preview toggle |
| 768–1023px | Sidebar becomes a drawer, tables scroll horizontally with a pinned first column |
| < 768px | Read-mostly: dashboard, candidate detail, application detail, follow-ups. Kanban becomes a status-filtered list. The resume builder stacks: Builder mode shows the section forms full width; Viewer mode fits the page to the screen. |

Mobile is for checking, not for working. Be honest about that in the UI rather than shipping a
cramped builder nobody can use.

## 12. Error and edge states to build explicitly

- Adapter 500 → error card with retry, never a blank screen
- Adapter 404 on a detail route → not-found state with a back link
- Role-forbidden route → a clear "you don't have access" screen, not a redirect loop
- Offline → a topbar banner, queued actions held in the store
- Slow AI simulation → staged progress with a cancel action after 8 seconds
- Empty after filtering → distinct from empty because nothing exists
- Optimistic update rejected → revert with a toast naming the reason
- Resume export blocked → gate message with a jump-to-claim link
- Duplicate job on capture → comparison card, merge or keep
- Session role switched mid-flight → refetch, don't leave stale data on screen
